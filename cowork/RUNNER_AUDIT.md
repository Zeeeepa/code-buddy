# Cowork runner audit — engine vs pi (2026-05-09)

> Snapshot at commit `a6568c59`. Maintained at each runner-related
> change so the deprecation path of `ClaudeAgentRunner` (pi-coding-agent)
> is traceable.

## TL;DR

- The **embedded Code Buddy core engine** is the **default runner** since
  post-2026-05 (`cowork/src/main/engine/embedded-mode.ts`). Opt-out via
  `CODEBUDDY_EMBEDDED=0`.
- `ClaudeAgentRunner` (pi) is now a **fallback** — only used when the
  engine bundle is missing (`MODULE_NOT_FOUND`) or explicitly disabled.
- The engine path is **functionally complete** for chat + tools +
  thinking + diff preview + cancellation, but **lacks Cowork-specific
  features** (MCP runtime sync, sudo password injection, skills hot-reload).

The remaining work is to fill those gaps so we can deprecate pi without
regressions.

## Files involved

| Layer | File | LOC | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| Boot | `cowork/src/main/engine/embedded-mode.ts` | 103 | Engine path resolution + opt-out policy |
| Bridge (main proc) | `cowork/src/main/engine/codebuddy-engine-runner.ts` | 571 | Translate `EngineStreamEvent` → `ServerEvent` |
| Adapter (core) | `src/desktop/codebuddy-engine-adapter.ts` | 313 | Wrap `CodeBuddyAgent.processUserMessageStream` |
| Adapter contract | `src/desktop/engine-adapter.ts` | 100 | `EngineAdapter` TS interface |
| Permission bridge | `dist/desktop/permission-bridge.js` | (built) | `DesktopPermissionBridge` for tool approvals |
| Legacy fallback | `cowork/src/main/claude/agent-runner.ts` | 2628 | pi-coding-agent path |

Cowork wiring at `cowork/src/main/index.ts:870-905` resolves the engine
bundle, instantiates `CodeBuddyEngineAdapter`, wires
`DesktopPermissionBridge`, then hands the adapter to `SessionManager`.
SessionManager picks `CodeBuddyEngineRunner` when the adapter is set,
otherwise falls back to `ClaudeAgentRunner`.

## Feature parity matrix

Status legend : **OK** (engine matches pi), **GAP** (engine missing
something pi has), **DIFF** (engine does it differently — usually
better), **N/A** (pi-specific quirk that doesn't apply to engine).

## Gaps prioritized for Phase 2

### Blocker (must fix before deprecating pi)

1. **MCP runtime sync** — when Patrice adds/removes/updates an MCP server
   in Settings, the engine doesn't see it. Two MCPManagers exist in
   parallel (Cowork side and core side). Fix : extend `EngineAdapter`
   interface with `setMcpServers(configs)` + a Cowork-side bridge that
   re-pushes whenever `invalidateMcpServersCache` would have fired.

### Medium (should fix soon, has UX impact)

2. **Hot-swap model** — switching model in a session today re-creates
   the agent + loses in-memory context. Workaround OK for V1, document.
3. **Permission UI consistency** — `permission.request` (pi) vs
   `permission.bridge.request` (engine) might use different modal
   shapes. Audit visually + unify if divergent.

### Low (acceptable V1, follow-up)

4. **Bash sudo password injection** — rare use case in Cowork,
   document as missing.
5. **Skills/plugins hot-reload** — restart workaround acceptable.
6. **Session cache LRU** — add max=10 + eviction to CodeBuddyEngineAdapter
   to match pi's behavior.
7. **`steer` / `run_event` chunks** — log-only is fine, no UI needed.

## How to verify which runner is active

At Cowork boot, look in the logs for one of:

- `[Main] Code Buddy engine adapter initialized (embedded mode)` →
  engine ON.
- `[Main] CODEBUDDY_EMBEDDED=0 — embedded engine disabled by env opt-out`
  → pi fallback (explicit).
- `[Main] Engine bundle missing at <path> — falling back to pi runner`
  → pi fallback (engine bundle absent — usually means
  `dist/desktop/codebuddy-engine-adapter.js` wasn't built).

To force pi for debugging :
```bash
CODEBUDDY_EMBEDDED=0 npm run dev
```

To force engine even if embedded-mode says no :
```bash
CODEBUDDY_ENGINE_PATH=/abs/path/to/dist npm run dev
```

(But normally engine is auto-detected — just `npm run dev` works.)

## Next steps

- Phase 2 : fix the blocker (MCP sync) + audit permission UI.
- Phase 3 : surface "active runner = engine | pi" in titlebar so
  Patrice sees instantly which path is active.
- Phase 5 : add tests so future changes don't silently break the
  engine path.
- Phase 6 : update `architecture.md` + CHANGELOG.
- Out of scope here : deprecate pi (V0.9+, after 4-6 weeks of
  engine-only daily use).
